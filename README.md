# 🚦 Rate Limiter Visualizer

Rate limiting is a **fundamental backend system design concept** used to control how frequently a client can access an API or service.
This project **implements real rate limiting algorithms on the backend** and **visualizes their behavior in real time on the frontend**, making abstract concepts intuitive and easy to reason about.

📷 Screenshots for each algorithm are included below.



## 🧠 Rate Limiting (Brief)

**Rate limiting** restricts how many requests a client can make within a defined time window
(e.g., *5 requests per 10 seconds*).

It is critical for:

* Protecting services from abuse and traffic spikes
* Preventing system overload and cascading failures
* Ensuring fair usage across users
* Maintaining predictable performance and costs

This is a core building block in almost every large-scale backend system.



## 🧩 Implemented Rate Limiting Algorithms

> All algorithms below are **fully implemented in the backend**.
> The frontend reflects **real allow / block decisions**, not mocked behavior.


### 1️⃣ Fixed Window Counter

Counts requests in fixed intervals and resets at each window boundary.

---

### 2️⃣ Sliding Window Log

Stores request timestamps and counts only those within the rolling window.

---

### 3️⃣ Sliding Window Counter

Uses weighted counts from the current and previous window to smooth burst traffic.

### 4️⃣ Token Bucket

Requests are allowed while tokens are available, refilled at a steady rate.

### 5️⃣ Leaky Bucket

Processes requests at a constant rate and drops excess traffic on overflow.

## 🗂 Backend Design (LLD-Oriented)

The backend is structured to clearly demonstrate **Low-Level Design principles** such as separation of concerns, extensibility, and clean abstractions.

```

├── dto               // API request/response models

```

### Design Highlights

* **Strategy Pattern** for interchangeable rate limiting algorithms
* **Factory Pattern** for runtime algorithm selection
* Each algorithm maintains **its own isolated state**
* Clear separation between **API layer, logic, and storage**
